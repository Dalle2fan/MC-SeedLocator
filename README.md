# Locate MineCraft structures from the seed

Code and WASM are extracted/reversed from Chunk Base.

**Main changes**:
- Make compatible with NodeJS
- Refactoring to allow for calling as functions instead of using worker/signals

Work in progress:
- Express API
- Fix stronghold locator
- Refactoring so Neovim can handle the code size
